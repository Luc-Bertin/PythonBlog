<p>It is often better to visualize data of apparent heterogeneity (sounds, images, text) as arrays of numbers, so to process these data or apply machine learning on them. A well-known package for creating and handling such arrays is Numpy (<em>Numerical Python</em>).</p>

<p>As we outlined in <strong>Beginning in Python</strong>, in Python, everything is anobject. Hence even the simple integer 3 is actually the value of an integer object with possible methods and attributes associated to it. Taking the reference implementation (CPython), it is actually a C structure under-the-hood, so are other Python primitives (list, tuple, set, dict, etc.). This brings an overhead</p>
