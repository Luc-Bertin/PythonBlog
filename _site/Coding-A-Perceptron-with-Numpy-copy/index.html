Les résultats doivent être sauvegardés sous forme d’un dictionnaire de:  clés  = paramètres utilisés valeurs = résultats obtenusExo4: Créez sa propre liste custom 😉: Créez une classe “Liste” qui permet quand l’on fait liste1 + liste2 de faire une addition sur chacun de leurs éléments 2 à 2.

    "url": "/setting-up-a-simple-flask-app/",
    "title": "Setting up a simple Flask app",
    "body": "2020/08/29 - Flask is a micro web framework written in Python, first released in 2010. It is lightweight (hence the “micro”), has more stars on GitHub that is “concurrent” Django — first released in 2005 — and is based on the philosophy that the main fundations and services are built into Flask and ready-to-use, while additional features can be seamlessly added to your app by installing extensions and initializing them to your app. 2 main dependencies:  Jinja2, a web templating engine Werkzeug, a WSGI library, provides a communication layer between your Python code and a WSGI-compatible server. Databases, forms validations, user authentification are provided by Flask extensions created by the community. Setting up the flask project: We need to create a Python virtual environement using venv, which comes in the standard Python library as of Python 3. 3.  Installation of flask module: pip install flaskFirst app: A client makes a request through an URL endpoint. An endpoint is specified as a relative or absolute url that usually results in a response from the server. Upon a request, the server (which can be the built-in WSGI flask dev-server, or a production-grade server such as Gunicorn), which are WSGI compatbile servers, passes this request to the application instance, an object of class/type Flask, which needs to handle it, what code should it run, code embedded within a function for that specific matched endpoint. This handling function is called a route. 	# creation of the application instance (there could be many)	from flask import Flask	app = Flask(__name__) # so flask knows where is the root path of the app# application instance is called `app`# those routes are handled by the application instance 'app' (`app` may be imported from a different file or this code could be simply written in the same file after the previous code block)# endpoint here is the root url '/'# the decorator turns root_url function to a  route function @app. route('/')def root_url():	# returned value = response	return  &lt;h1&gt;Hello !&lt;/h1&gt; # endpoint here is '/home/'# with dynamic url routing@app. route('/home/&lt;name&gt;/')def second_url_function_handler():	# name becomes an argument that you can use in the decorated function wrapped by flask decorator	response_string =  &lt;h1&gt;Hello to Home {}!&lt;/h1&gt; . format(name)	return response_stringYou can access the request object within route functions to get more insight of the incoming request (args, method, json). This “context glocal” variable is accessible by pushing the request context so Flask knows in which environment/thread/client request he is operating on. The same way, session object is persistent between requests (can be used to store user informations) and depends on the request context too. Finally, g and current_app depend on the application context, g is reset between each request and used as storage during handling of requests. app. url_map shows all the mapped URL endpoint to routes. Responses::  returned value(s) from the route as a tuple.  better: make_response(data, HTTP_code, [dict_of_header]), you can set additional things using methods of the response object such as setting cookies redirect(url_to_redirect) (flask automatically set the default 302 HTTP response code used for redirection). Adding extension(s):: from flask_extension import TheClassthe_instance = TheClass(app) # app instance goes in the constructor of the extension flask-script: add command-line parser instead of modifying args in app. run() flask-bootstrap: open source CSS framework from Twitter (also include some js animations)To connect from another host in the network: FLASK_ENV=development python . /script. py runserver -h 192. 168. 0. 16presentation logic: what the user sees and interact with. business logic: processings invisible to the user. view functions handle both logics by design, but it is better to allocate presentation logic to the templating engine Jinja to improve readibility and maintainability of the app. The template is a file that contains the text of the response, with placeholder variables or dynamic parts (loops/conditions) changing from a request to the other. The rendering is the process of associating the computed value from the request to the template placeholders. Templates are located in “templates” subfolder by default (can be change in Flask constructor) Then in the view function:render_template(file. html, key1=val1, key2=val2) the value could be of any type (dict, list, user-defined objects, etc. )  filters modify variables in-place {{ variable | filter_name }} example1: capitalize to capitalize the variable : “luc” -&gt; “Luc”   example2: safe to avoid escaping the content of the variable (hence you can put some html tags inside variable it will be rendered as is). Be careful though on security concerns (malicious code that can be inserted into your website).   conditional statements and loops:  include an html file as is — for example a navigation bar that does not need to be changed — from a template file to another  for portion of html code that need to be modified by a template you can use and in file_with_blocs. html: A good practice would be to create different categories of pages with a layout by creating base. html file(s) and derive them for all pages being part of some kind of subcategory. Subcategories can also further be extended: adding an error handler for a webpage returning some error code: @app. errorhandler(404)def page_not_found(e):	return render_template('404. html'), 404This handler function won’t be call unless an Exception is raised, here an HTTPException. Hence we need to import and raises it first: from werkzeug. exceptions import HTTPExceptionThen for any endpoint that does not match our previous urls in the url_map, an HTTPException is raised along with the path variable. @app. route('/&lt;path:nompath&gt;')def error_test(nompath):	# raises an HTTPException of status code 404	# nompath is the error message	# retrieved from e in page_not_found(e)	abort(404, nompath)Links should not be hard-coded into the templates folder either.  to respect the DRY principle (Don’t Repeat Yourself) also because it is too complex to write dynamic paths (based on the name provided by a person for example just as for routes handling)url_for is here for the rescue!, its parameters are the:  1st parameter: the name of the routed function any number of keyword arguments, each corresponding to a variable part of the URL rule.  _external(Boolean): if evaluated to True, returns the absolute URL, otherwise relative to the root ‘/’.  unrecognized params are appended to the URL as query parameters e. g. test=25 /?test=25from flask import url_forOpening the interpreter we can check what url_for could build us: with app. app_context():	with current_app. test_request_context():		url_for('second_url_function_handler', name= luc )We obtain ‘/home/luc’ which makes sense with the route logic. Now we can use it in our template file, for example in the navigation. html Hence we just linked the route url with the navigation link But url_for can also be used in the routes handling: # just as an example@app. route('/admin/')def admin():  if not loggedin:  	# should login endpoint exist    return redirect(url_for('login'))And even querying static files (images, assets, CSS) using url_for(‘static’) along with the filename param (e. g. filename='logos/favicon. ico'). Forms: You can access data from POST requests on forms using request. form. Why using an extension for forms then ?  For automatic rendering of HTML for the forms (based on a library call WTForms), mainly based on the data type required for each component of the form.  data validation (critical, before storing in a database for example) CSRF protection: to avoid malicious persons making hidden malicious requests from another website visited by a user who is logged-in to the first, and on behalf on him/her (cookies are sent automatically along with the request). CSRF protectionWe first need a key which create encrypted tokens passed along with the form to make sure of user authenticity. the server would generate a random string and add it as an hidden field to the form which is accessible only by the user app. config[ SECRET_KEY ] =  randomly generated string A Form Class: To create a form, define a Class “data model”. Each class attribute = a fieldEach field can have multiple validations hence validators with it. 1st argument is the label of the field, visible to the user. from wtforms import Form, StringField, SubmitField, IntegerFieldfrom wtforms. validators import DataRequired, Lengthclass MyForm(Form):  name = StringField( Name , validators=[DataRequired()])  age = IntegerField( Age , validators=[Length(min=13,max=19), Required()])  submit = SubmitField( Submit )Here is a list of built-in validators provided by the extension. You can also build your custom validators by creating callable classes After that, you can simply import functions for WTF forms rendering using Bootstrap and call wtf. quick_form() directly on the MyForm object instance. To pass the form object, we need to change a bit the index function, corresponding to the url endpoint hit by the client where the form will be visible. from Miguel Grinberg’s book:  Adding POST to the method list is necessary because form submissions are much more conveniently handled as POST requests. It is possible to submit a form as a GET request, but as GET requests have no body, the data is appended to the URL as a query string and becomes visible in the browser’s address bar. For this and several other reasons, form submissions are almost universally done as POST requests. instance_Form. validate_on_submit(): True if form submitted and data valid. When a browser is refresh, the last request is submitted again, which is a form submission, leading to a warning by the browser of a double submit. To counteract this we have to do redirect HTTP get request back to the form or in another endpoint/place. But then, after an HTTP redirect, we don’t have memory anymmore of the values submitted by the user, we then use the request-context global variable sessionfor memorizing informations among different requests.  From pythonise. com Sessions in Flask are a way to store information about a specific user from one request to the next. They work by storing a cryptographically signed cookie on the users browser and decoding it on every request. You can set the datetime. delta for when the session should be erased. They expire if the user close the browser, unless we specify: flask sessions expire once you close the browser, unless modify the permanent attribute and set a timeout for expiration. session. permanent = Trueapp. permanent_session_lifetime = timedelta(minutes=30) # lasts 30 minutesThose line can be encapsulated within a request hook i. e. : @app. before_first_requestdef permanent_session():	. . . 	# here	. . . You can also play with those items to set a short timedelta value within a before_request hook. Hence an short inactivity would lead to the user being kicked out of the website. Databases: We will use the ORM SQLAlchemy using the extension Flask-SQLAlchemy. ORM is short for Object-relational mapper. It is an higher level of abstraction that enables you to define the data model for your website using Python classes. One class for each table, each class attribute for a field, in an analogous way when we created forms using Flask WTForms. The main advantage of doing so is mainly because it makes it a very easy-to-use and highly portable solution, since you can sometimes use the same classes for different databases engine (SQLAlchemy will take care of converting those Python representations of the data model into a set of SQL instructions for the proper database engine to create the corresponding table(s)). pip install flask-sqlalchemyWe now have to create a new entry in the flask app. config object to incorporate the URI location for the database engine (i. e. “where can i locate the database”). # we will use here the SQLite as it is stored in a disk in the computer rather that relying on another server hosting the database service (either on the same computer or outside). # absolute path of the directory containing this filebasedir = os. path. abspath(os. path. dirname(__file__))app. config[ SQLALCHEMY_DATABASE_URI ] = 'sqlite:///' + os. path. join(basedir, 'data. sqlite')Here are the defined models. 1 User can have multiple Posts1 Post have 1 User onlyHence Post is the thinnest degree of granularity if we where to join those 2 tables. It has a foreign key of user representing the user. id_ values. And a relationship is created on the User model with respect to Post to make SQLAlchemy understand the relationship, giving meanwhile a backref for how to refer to a user instance from a post level. ### models ####class Post(db. Model):  __tablename__ =  posts   id_ = db. Column(db. Integer, primary_key=True)  name = db. Column(db. String(64), unique=True)  # 1 User can have multiple Posts.   # Hence we need to put a foreignkey on the Posts,   # where the level of granularity is the thinnest   # (idpost1-user1, idpost2, user1, etc. )  user_id = db. Column(db. Integer, db. ForeignKey( users. id_ )) # the ids in this column match with the ids column in user.   # and a relationship in the  Parent  to link them.   def __repr__(self):    return  Post: {}: name {} . format(self. id_, self. name)class User(db. Model):  # renaming the table and not default user  __tablename__ =  users   id_ = db. Column(db. Integer, primary_key=True)  username = db. Column(db. String(64), unique=True, index=True)  # this is how SQLAlchemy understand there is a relationship with the model Post  posts = db. relationship( Post , backref= user )  # posts will show a list of related post to one user  # from post, you can access to the user as an object using the backref instead of the  user  foreign_key (which returns only the user id)    def __repr__(self):    return  User {}: with name: {} . format(self. id_, self. username)###############using uselist=False (in the db. relationship()) lead to a one-to-one relationship instead of one-to-many relationship. To create the tables from the models we can interactively open a python interpreter using: python script. py shelland instruct: from script import dbdb. create_all()A new data. sqlite file is created (using the URI defined in the app. config). As highlighted by Miguel Grinberg, db. create_all() does not update on models changes in the code. Hence a base solution (not the best, especially if your website run and you want to migrate smoothly without loosing your data) is to do a: db. drop_all()db. create_all()note the during the db. drop_all() process, only the tables are being deleted/dropped, not the database-file itself (same for db. create_all() if a database-file at the URI does already exist). Below is a cope snipped to play with the database, create new entries, set them, filter some python script. py shellfrom script import dbfrom script import User, Postdb. create_all()# You can query using the `ModelClass. query`# From simple queryUser. query. all() # all usersPost. query. all() # all posts# You can insert new elements / rows by first creating the higher-level Python instancesuser1 = User(username =  David )user2 = User(username =  Corentin )user3 = User(username =  Joséphine )post1 = Post(name =  Le savoir-faire , user = user1)post2 = Post(name =  L'étrange Noël , user = user1)post3 = Post(name =  coder en Python , user = user2)# Using a dict and unpacking it inside the function signaturepost4_dict = {  name :  coder en C ,  user : user2 }post4 = Post( **post4_dict ) # SQLAlchemy will take care of assigning a primary key id_ when writing into the database# print(user1. id_) output None so far# add the changes to be madedb. session. add(user1) db. session. add(user2)db. session. add(user3)db. session. add(post1)db. session. add_all( [ post2, post3, post4 ])# write the changes to the database# “All-or-nothing”, if any error occurs, the previous state is unchanged. db. session. commit()# Querying againUser. query. all() # all usersPost. query. all() # all posts# To more advanced ones# We define a query objectone_query = Post. query. filter_by(name= Le savoir-faire )# We execute the query using `all()`one_query. all()# Some other examplesPost. query. filter_by(user=user1). all()# the equivalent using `filter`Post. query. filter(Post. user == user1). all()Post. query. filter(Post. user. has(username= David )). all()# we can also use other type of operatorsPost. query. group_by(Post. name). all()executed_query = Post. query. group_by(Post. name). all()one_post = executed_query[0]one_post. userexecuted_query = User. query. filter_by(username= David ). all()executed_query[0]. posts# when using `posts` from the db. relationship, a query is issued but it returns here a list, no longer queryable, we would want to query the objects it could contain. This can be circumvented using `lazy = 'dynamic’` in `db. relationship` so query is not issued too soonMigrations: Dropping and recreating all the tables in the database each time the data model change a little bit is really neither convenient nor easy to maintain, even more in the situation where your application is already deployed and registering user or user’s data that you don’t want to be lost. Alembic is a tool which checks changes in your data model and creates migrations scripts for SQLAlchemy database migrations. Each script contains 2 Python functions (upgrade and downgrade) which can be invoked directly by command-line using Flask-Migrate extensions, so to perform changes on the database level. upgrade() applies the new changes while downgrade() does the exact inverse, allowing you to go to any structures your tables had at a certain timepoint. Installation of Flask-Migrate: pip install flask-migrateImport ad connection to the app: from flask-migrate import Migrate, MigrateCommand # adding an handler for web pagemigrate = Migrate(app, db)# to run as command line options using Flask Scriptmanager. add_command('db', MigrateCommand)Creation of the migration folder: python script. py db initCreation of the first script (from nothing to actual table structure): python script. py db migrate -m  first migration You can known check the scripts in the migration folder which should look like that: def upgrade():  # ### commands auto generated by Alembic - please adjust! ###  op. create_table('users',  sa. Column('id_', sa. Integer(), nullable=False),  sa. Column('username', sa. String(length=64), nullable=True),  sa. PrimaryKeyConstraint('id_')  )  op. create_index(op. f('ix_users_username'), 'users', ['username'], unique=True)  op. create_table('posts',  sa. Column('id_', sa. Integer(), nullable=False),  sa. Column('name', sa. String(length=64), nullable=True),  sa. Column('user_id', sa. Integer(), nullable=True),  sa. ForeignKeyConstraint(['user_id'], ['users. id_'], ),  sa. PrimaryKeyConstraint('id_'),  sa. UniqueConstraint('name')  )  # ### end Alembic commands ###def downgrade():  # ### commands auto generated by Alembic - please adjust! ###  op. drop_table('posts')  op. drop_index(op. f('ix_users_username'), table_name='users')  op. drop_table('users')  # ### end Alembic commands ###This is the same as creating the tables the first time. After that, any new changes in the model and any new migrations scripts derived from them will be incremental changes from the current model. The script isn’t applied yet, it was here for review. To apply it (and in that case actually create the 2 tables along with their data attributes), let’s run upgrade() python script. py db upgradeoutput: INFO [alembic. runtime. migration] Running upgrade -&gt; 3dc85275c029, first migrationYou can finally:  create a GitHub repository create a . gitignore file (to exclude including unecessary myenv virtual environment) create a requirements. txt file where all files will be create a READMe. md markdown file for the users who will go to this GitHub repository"

You can then adress the object by using its associated name. But is any binding created within a block still visible anywhere in the code? By  visible  we not only mean nameA exists, but that the relation to the object objectA is still valid. The  where  the bindings, defined in a block, are  visible/meaningful , is also named scope of a name/variable. scopes are determined statically, they are used dynamically Sometimes, scope is also defined as the set of variables/names available at a certain point in the code, but this refers more to the context of namespaces. but it is better to take the definition of W3Schools:  A variable is only available from inside the region it is created.

If you make an assignement in the function scope, a becomes a local-variable to that function block and **shadows** any same named variable in the outer/enclosing scope. “The compiler recognizes this as a local-variable. Hence any statement before the variable has actually been assigned raise an UnboundLocalError.  Same explanation in different words from the docs: “If a name binding operation occurs anywhere within a code block all uses of the name within the block are treated as references to the current block. This rule is subtle. Python lacks declarations. The local variables of a code block can be determined by scanning the entire text of the block for name binding operations” If you recall the course from the functional programming, it is the same type of behavior when any yield word scanned within the function body makes it a generator To workaround this issue, we can use global keyword, saying “no, this is not a local variable, use the global variable a that must have been defined elsewhere, at top-level module. a = 4print(id(a))def multiply_by_2():  global a  print(id(a), a) # same object location  a+=1  print(id(a), a) # different because it is an immutable  b = 2  return a*bBERTINmultiply_by_2()44654740804465474080 44465474112 510if the name is not found in the function body or enclosing scopes, you get a NameError exception a = 4Luc BERTINdef multiply_by_2():  return a*cmultiply_by_2()---------------------------------------------------------------------------NameError                 Traceback (most recent call last)&lt;ipython-input-39-64522ae2309b&gt; in &lt;module&gt;----&gt; 1 multiply_by_2()&lt;ipython-input-36-9910d1b69fd6&gt; in multiply_by_2()   2    3 def multiply_by_2():----&gt; 4   return a*cNameError: name 'c' is not definednamespaces: Python needs to keep track of all the ‘visible’ bindings within a block, or at a certain point of the program, this is also called namespace or context. {  symbolic_name1 : referenced object1,   symbolic_name2 : referenced object2}Namespaces are implemented as dictionaries in Python, a table listing symbolic variables/names (keys) to their objects (values) at a certain point in the program. back to the definition of scope we can pick up from the [docs]:(https://docs. python. org/3/tutorial/classes. html)  A scope is a textual region of a Python program where a namespace is directly accessible. globals() is a built-in function which returns the global namespace/context globals()['a']BERTIN4You can use it to change a globally defined binding globals()['a'] = 37print(a)37locals()is a built-in function which returns the local namespace in the top-level module, locals and globals return the same thing locals() is globals()Truebut inside a function it is not, def function():  a = 2  print(  Is locals() same as globals()? {} . format(locals() is globals()))   print(  Locals dictionary: {} . format(locals()))  print(  What about name a in globals(): {} . format({k:v for k,v in globals(). items() if k=='a'}))function(Luc BERTIN)Is locals() same as globals()?

    "body": "2020/08/22 - 1st course will mainly focus on how to approach Python for the first time. For that we will use Jupyter module. “In Python, everything is an object”: This is a very well-known sentence but I think it is the best, along with some examples, to start getting a good grasp of the language. In Python, everything is an object, according to the creator of Python, Guido van Rossum:  One of my goals for Python was to make it so that all objects were “first class. ” By this, I meant that I wanted all objects that could be named in the language (e. g. , integers, strings, functions, classes, modules, methods, etc. ) to have equal status. That is, they can be assigned to variables, placed in lists, stored in dictionaries, passed as arguments, and so forth”s Let’s dive-in a bit, and then experiment from there: In Python EVERYTHING IS AN OBJECT ! a = 2Here a is a name, refering to an integer of value 2, which is also (spoil alert) an object. Note that we didn’t have to declare a memory space holding this data type like in C syntax: int a; /* creating a memory space allowing only holding data of integer type. */a = 3 /* storing the value 3; not a string, not a list, but an integer as asked. */C is said statically typed: type of a is already known and constrained at compile time in Python, a = 2 first creates an object of value 2 at a certain memory space, and then links the name a to that object location during assignment. a is then bound to that object by pointing to its memory location. a variable can then change of type during its lifetime, as its simply a pointer ! a will be simply redirecting to another object of different data type. The type is then not associated to a but to the run-time values, Python is then dynamically-typed Hence i can write: a = 30then a =  Bonjour ìd() is a built-in function that can show us the memory location of the object (at least for CPython implementation), and is certified to be unique to an object, and still during the lifetime of this object Hence, in Python, every object has an identity id(a)4754628528import syssys. getrefcount(a)2Note that if an object (example: the object “Bonjour” is not linked anymore by any names (a etc), then it can be garbage-collected.

Every object has an identity, a type and a value The type ! Let’s check the type of both of these objects print(type(2)); print(type( Bonjour ))&lt;class 'int'&gt;&lt;class 'str'&gt;type( bonjour )str2 is value of an object of type integer. “Bonjour” is the value of an object of type string. If you see “class” in the print statement, you can also say the class or type of the object of value 2 is integer, as type and class in Python3 as beed unified concepts, see also here or object of value 2 is an instance of class integer, integer class being also an object as everything is an object (go to see the role of metaclasses) Are the methods from dir(a) familiar ? Those methods are relative to a string object Let’s try lower() We can access it by using the “dot” notation after the object refered by a, so to access the method corresponding to a a. lower&lt;function str. lower()&gt;we can see it is a function, so we need to use the parenthesis. a. lower()'yo'it is a special kind of function though, because it is applied on its corresponding object refered by a, which is an instance of str. This function is also called a method. And this method is already bound to instance a Back to the first link article i’ve pinned where Rossum describes he wanted all objects to be “first classes”, he highlighted a very interesting conception issue raised with respect to bound and unbound methods; although deprecated in Python3, you should have a look at it anyway. method_ = a. lowermethod_()'yo'type(a)strWe could also do: unbound_method_ = str. lower # &lt;the_class&gt;. &lt;the_method_defined_in_class_body&gt;unbound_method_(a)'yo'Note that str is called a built-in type, in CPython implementation, str is a C struct.

Should you try to find if a value is in the list, a tuple, or a character in a string, a linear search 0(N) would be operated as you need to go through the entire list by creating an iterator out of it to find a specified matching value.  stackoverflow: x in y calls y. contains(x) if y has a contains member function.

    "body": "2020/08/14 - This tutorial helps newcomers to install Python properly and manage different Python versions, especially for Mac users having a system 2. 7 Python installed already. A few basics first: The shell PATH is an environment variable that lists of directories browsed from left to right by the shell to look for a requested executable. e. g. on a MacOS system python can be found in /usr/bin. If PATH = /usr/bin:/usr/local/bin and python can be found in both directories, left one take precedence. In Unix, /usr/local/bin are user-installed executables, /bin contains executables which are required by the system for emergency repairs and /usr/bin are application binaries meant to be accessed by locally logged in users. PROTIP from Wilson Mar: “The /usr/bin/ folder is owned by the operating system, so elevated sudo priviledges are required to modify files in it (such as “python”). So Homebrew and other installers install to /usr/local/ which does NOT require sudo to access” Mac OS:: Best summarising article on the different approaches, prons and cons. Mac OS X 10. 8 comes with Python 2. 7 pre-installed by Apple. On a unix stackexchange forum:“Changing the default Python (or Perl, etc) on an OS is really bad idea. This interpreter is actually part of the OS and there may well be other OS components that are written specifically to work with that version of the interpreter. For example on Redhat the yum tool that performs system software updates is a python application. You really don’t want to break this. Such applications may depend on specific, perhaps non standard, python modules being installed which the version you installed may not have. For example on Ubuntu I believe some of the built-in OS tools written in Python use an ORM called Storm that isn’t part of the Python standard library. Does your clean Python 2. 7 install have the specific expected version of the Storm module installed? Does it have any version of Storm? No? Then you’ve just broken a chunk of your OS. ” Recently running on Mac OS Catalina, i’ve noticed a python3 executable located in usr/bin, i suspect this came along with the MacOS update and we shouldn’t touch that either. 4 solutions here for an installation of a personnal Python, best one is definitely last one ! 2nd one is not bad either for beginners. 1. From the Python docs::  The Apple-provided build of Python is installed in /System/Library/Frameworks/Python. framework and /usr/bin/python, respectively. You should never modify or delete these, as they are Apple-controlled and are used by Apple- or third-party software. Remember that if you choose to install a newer Python version from python. org, you will have two different but functional Python installations on your computer, so it will be important that your paths and usages are consistent with what you want to do. You can read the docs to have a simple installation yet functionnal. This is the simplest approach to get a Python3 interpreter. 2. Another article suggests using the Homebrew approach,: Homebrew is a free downloadable package manager tool for MacOS (similar to apt-get for Ubuntu), and leaves it manage and update for us the python version using: brew update &amp;&amp; brew upgrade python which we would call later on using python3 command (or creating a shebang on top of the file to instruct the shell to use the python3 executable). Note that using shortcut like shell aliases to prefer using “python” over “python3” imply 2 things:  aliases takes precedence over PATH browsing, but in case not corresponding aliases are defined or no shell are being involved (don’t forget that aliases are a shell feature), PATH will be read.  using aliases might cause problems in case of virtual environments (pip aliased to pip3 won’t look at virtual env pip one!)3. Using PyEnv: Pyenv is a tool to isolate different versions of Python i. e. isolated environements for Python. From the GitHub of the author : “It’s simple, unobtrusive, and follows the UNIX tradition of single-purpose tools that do one thing well”. Also, “pyenv does not depend on Python itself. pyenv was made from pure shell scripts. There is no bootstrap problem of Python”. Seems as a good candidate to better manage multiple Python versions. This is different from virtualenv : a tool which creates isolated virtual python environments for the per-project specific Python libraries. You can then define a Python version to run globally, or per-project basis ! Step-by-Step process: Install pyenv using Homebrew  brew install pyenvInstall a version of Python using pyenv  pyenv install 3. 8. 5To have pyenv effects available at each shell instantiation you need to modify the bashrc or zshrc file: ## does pyenv exist as a command ? then init pyenv and virtualenv if command -v pyenv 1&gt;/dev/null 2&gt;&amp;1; then eval  $(pyenv init -)  fiUse cases:  Wanna define this version of Python as a global version ? (and not care about system Python): Check which versions are available:     pyenv install list   pyenv global 3. 8. 5   then run python and check the output/    Wanna define this version of Python as per-project basis ?     cd project/   pyenv local 3. 8. 5   this writes a . python-version file in working directory.    Then run python in and outside the directory and notice the difference ;    Remove any versions ?     pyenv uninstall 3. 8. 5    See which versions you can have and switch in:     pyenv versions   to switch between one another: use global as in 1.     See where is the real executable path (not renaming based on intercepting the command, which is what shims do)     pyenv which python    Better:     using virtualenv AND pyenv using pyenv-virtualenv plugin, create a new environment with a Python version   pyenv virtualenv 3. 8. 5 myenv   cd project_where_i_should_need_to_active_myenv/   pyenv local myenv   4. Anaconda: You can simply install the installer from anaconda, you shouldn’t modify PATH:  Should I add Anaconda to the macOS or Linux PATH? We do not recommend adding Anaconda to the PATH manually. During installation, you will be asked “Do you wish the installer to initialize Anaconda3 by running conda init?” We recommend “yes”. If you enter “no”, then conda will not modify your shell scripts at all. In order to initialize after the installation process is done, first run source /bin/activate and then run conda init. In zsh, a command not found error might occur on typing conda command, to fix this, use steps cited here Windows:: From official Python docs:  Unlike most Unix systems and services, Windows does not include a system supported installation of Python. To make Python available, the CPython team has compiled Windows installers (MSI packages) with every release for many years. ” The full installer contains all components and is the best option for developers using Python for any kind of project. 1. Pyenv-win: For windows user: https://github. com/pyenv-win/pyenv-win 2. Anaconda:: Installation using the GUI installerFrom the anaconda docs:  Should I add Anaconda to the Windows PATH?When installing Anaconda, we recommend that you do not add Anaconda to the Windows PATH because this can interfere with other software. Instead, open Anaconda with the Start Menu and select Anaconda Prompt, or use Anaconda Navigator (Start Menu - Anaconda Navigator). Enjoy Python ! ;) "

    "title": "Introduction to functional programming",
    "body": "2020/08/03 - You’ve probably heard of list comprehension in Python before. It is a declarative-like, concise, and generally easier way to read than a simple for loop. Example: [x ** 2 for x in [0,1,2]]Have you also heard of generator expression in Python? (x ** 2 for x in [0,1,2])Reduced to appearance, the only notable difference would be the removal of brackets for the addition of parentheses? But is this really the case in practice? Have you noticed that you can easily iterate over a list, dictionary, tuple, or string with a for loop?What are the shared similarities among all of these built-in types ?  Why functional programming ?: Picking up the definition from the python docs: functional programming is the principle of breaking down a problem into a set of functions which take inputs and produce outputs. They have no internal states subject to altering the output produced for a given input, and act deterministically for some given conditions. We can therefore in a certain way oppose functional programming to object-oriented programming in which an instance of a class can see its internal state, represented by its attributes, be modified internally by the call of associated methods. Thanks to this definition we can already understand the assets of functional programming. First by its modularity: each function would fulfill a precise, well-defined task and we could therefore break down a large problem into several mini-problems in the form of functions. Then each function would be easy to test (by that I mean develop an associated unit-test) due to its reduced action spectrum and its deterministic side. In a data scientist approach, this approach would allow us to build pipelines, in which some flow of data would pass through different processing functions, the output of one would be the input for another, and so on. Another big advantage is the parallelization: as each function is stateless and deterministic i. e. f(x)=y, if we wish to transform a sequence of elements, we can transform parallely each element x1, x2, x3,… of this sequence into y1, y2, y3,… by calling f in parallel for each input Here, of course, I show a fairly simplistic but totally viable diagram, for example transforming the column of a dataset into a log. 1. the iteratorsAgain, based on the official python documentation: an Iterator is an object representing a sequence of data. The object returns data one item at a time, much like a bookmark in a book announces the page of that book. It is an object that enables to traverse a container, such as list or dict. To know if we are dealing with an iterator we must look in the magic methods associated with this object: if the object contains the __next__() and __iter__() methods then it is an iterator. This is also called the iterator protocol. This method can also be called by the function: next(iterator) and simply allows you to return the next element of the sequence, as by moving the bookmark of the book. If the last element is reached and __next__() is called again, a StopIteration exception is raised. A list is a sequence of elements, is a list an iterator?We can call dir(), a built-in function that returns a list of attributes and methods (magic or not) for a given object.  We can see that __next__ does not exist here. List is therefore not an iterator. On the other hand, we see that the __iter__() method exists: This method can also be invoked from the iter(list) function. What does iter() produce from this list? Iter seems to return an iterator from the list. We can verify it as follows: If we do the same thing on a dictionary, this is what we get.  Again an iterator. Now, we can return each of the elements sequentially by calling next().  Conversely, we can also call iterator. __next__()Note again that next(a_list) cannot be done, the error message is self-explanatory.  Thus we see that a dictionary or a list, although being a sequence of objects, are not iterators, but iterables, that is to say that we can create an iterator from those - here by calling the __iter__ method, the iterator being, I remind you, is an object, which returns its elements one by one thanks to the implementation of its __next__ method. In a similar fashion, we can therefore consider the book as an iterable, i. e. a sequence of elements from which we can create an object that returns each of its pages one by one. We also see that only the dictionary keys are returned here. (Reminder, if we want to return tuples of (key, value) we can use the items () method in python 3+).  Isn’t this behavior similar to what you would get by looping with for? This is what is implicitly done when looping through a dictionary or a list:As the python documentation shows, these 2 loops are equivalent. for i in iter(obj):  print(i)for i in obj:  print(i)So that’s what’s behind it when you loop through a sequence of tuple, list, or dictionary elements. Note that we can also express an iterator as a list or tuple from the constructor of these objects which can admit an iterator as a parameter. To get the original dictionary from the old example again we can also call the dict() constructor on the previously discussed item_iterator.  If we can extract an iterator from an iterable, and iterate over it, what’s the point of this extra step, why doesn’t list understand the __next__ method? Well because an iterator can only be iterated once, once “consumed” it is necessary to recreate a new iterator from the iterable. The idea is that a new iterator will start at the beginning, while a partially used iterator picks up where it left off.  Wikipedia defines it well: you must see an iterator as an object that enables a programmer to traverse a container and gives access to data elements from this container. This iterator could use data stored in memory (from a list by iterating on it), or read a file or generate each value “on-the-fly”. Here is a Counter class which defines an iterator, here the values ​​are generated on-the-fly rather than stored previously in a list. You are probably starting to understand now the crucial functionality that some iterators bring, if you do not need to store all the values ​​in memory, where in the case of infinite sequence, you can successively generate the values ​​and do calculations on these at the time of iteration / “lazy generation” which results in less memory usage. Some iterable are lazy too, it’s the case of map objects. 1234567891011class Counter:  def __init__(self, low, high):    self. current = low - 1    self. high = high   def __iter__(self):    return self   def __next__(self):     self. current += 1    if self. current &lt; self. high:      return self. current    raise StopIterationfor c in Counter(3, 9):  print(c)345678Note: iterators implement __iter__ method just as iterables, they just return themselves (return self), they can then be used in for-loops just the same way iterables did. Use case: opening a file using the built-in open() function generates a file object which turns out to be an iterator!Reading line by line using a for loop implicitly calls the readline method, so only certain lines can be re-requisitioned on demand, rather than reading the whole file in memory, particularly useful in the event of a large file! We can therefore only traverse the file once (unless we reopen and recreate another iterator), and can just load the lines on demand that we want! Something interesting to mention, calling __iter__ on a iterable such as a list returns a new iterator each time (reading the beginning of this article should help you understand why). However, doing the same thing on an iterator returns himself. Have a look at the below screenshot and then look back at the Counter class definition.  2. the generators: Don’t get me wrong, generators are not something different from an iterator, they are actually iterators. Conversely, iterators are not all generators. Why are generators objects… iterators? because they implement __next__and __iter__ methods. How to create a generator object? from a generator function or a generator expression. What are the purpose of doing so? writing a generator function (or a generator) expression is generally being easier to write than iterators (where we created a class and implemented by hand the 2 magic methods). Here we will implement some sort of logic in a function or an expression. When called they will return a generator object which behave the same way as the iterator i’ve mentionned. I will then break this section in 2 parts: generators expression and generators ‘functions’, as they share similarities in their implementation. Generators expressions:: Back to the first paragraphe of this chapter, we talked about list comprehension and generator expression.  Here you can see the object returned behaves exactly as an iterator. It is indeed an iterator. But, once again, why not using simply list comprehension rather than generator expression? because of memory usage and lazyness evaluation of each item. When we use a list comprehension, every element of the list have been computed and the whole result is returned as a list with allocated memory space.  When we use a gen expression, elements of the sequence are evaluated only when requested (lazy evaluation). This lead to use less memory and sometimes, depending on what you do thereafter, an increase in performance. Note that range(start, stop[, step]) here is actually an iterable. It does not implement __next__ unless you call iter() on it. However, range implement lazyness implementation, just like previously showed iterators, it will always take the same (small) amount of memory, no matter the size of the range it represents (as it only stores the start, stop and step values, calculating individual items and subranges as needed). Also range has the nice property to be indexable, which is not the case of our simple generator expression.  I can then start doing fancy stuff such as piping generator expression: Here is a code to make an generator indexable, seems beautiful. Have to test it . Generators functions:: Have you ever seen the yield keyword in certain functions before ? That keyword tranforms the function definition into a special type of function — when compiled into Bytecode —, named generator functions, also abbrieved generators. Instead of destroying local variables defined in the scope of a normal function when this function returns a value or ends, you can here resume the function where it left-off, preserving those local variables. Test those lines of code from the documentation and see the behavior of the function. 123def generate_ints(N):  for i in range(N):    yield iThe generator function, when called, returns a generator object, which is an iterator, which implements next and iter and controls the execution of the generator function. Close behavior to a generator expression here. Hence the close names. yield operates just like a return statement then, but preserved the state of the local variables for later ‘next’ calls.  As you can also see, the above function is easier to write than Counter although achieving the same thing at last. As highlighted by the Python docs, you can also send values to the generator by writing: val = (yield i). Actually, the value of the yield expression after resuming the function is None if __next__() has been used. Otherwise, if send() was used, then the result will be the value passed in to that method. Have a look at the counter definition from the docs: 123456789def counter(maximum):  i = 0  while i &lt; maximum:    val = (yield i)    # If value provided, change counter    if val is not None:      i = val    else:      i += 1and the output where you can send an arbitrary value inside of the &gt;&gt;&gt; it = counter(10) &gt;&gt;&gt; next(it) 0&gt;&gt;&gt; next(it) 1&gt;&gt;&gt; it. send(8) 8&gt;&gt;&gt; next(it) 9&gt;&gt;&gt; next(it) Traceback (most recent call last): File  t. py , line 15, in &lt;module&gt;  it. next()StopIterationhence, yield does not only preserve local variable but gives us an entrypoint to the generator function to send input. 3. Functions: Now that you have a good grasp on how to design one-time objects that read through a sequence of elements, it is to browse some built-in Python functions that leverage use of iterators. any() and all(): Clearly the first ones that come up to my mind: those functions are evaluating trueness of elements of a sequence.  any return True if any element of a sequence is true (caution: 0 and None are falsy) all return True is all element of a sequence evaluates to true. But the most interesting about those 2 functions is that they are lazy, this means, they abort as soon as the outcome is clear. Combined to a generator expression, this could drastically improve performance rather than using a list-comprehension (hence resulting in returning a complete list first before evaluating trueness of the elements)Don’t do that: all([x for x in range(0,100000000)]) But that: all((x for x in range(0,100000000))) compare the difference in execution time, why do the second one stop so quickly ? (reminder: 0 is falsy) By the way, you can delete the parentheses when the generator expression is used directly in a function that can expect to take iterators as parameter. map(function, sequence(s)) (imap in Python 2+): In Python 2 (deprecated as of 2020), imap is the lazy version of map. In Python 3+, map replaced imap. Thus as of Python3+, just use only map. map returns a map object an iterator and evaluates an iterator as parameter lazily evaluated.  Interesting sidenote i didn’t know before reading the docs, you can use map with 2 or more iterators and encapsulate them in the lambda x1,x2,x3,… function. filter(function, sequence): Also returns an iterator, whose content has been filtered from another sequence.  1st parameter: a function to evaluate trueness, if None : return only non-falsy elements from the sequence 2nd parameter: iterableevaluationNote that filter(function, iterable) is equivalent to the generator expression (item for item in iterable if function(item)) if function is not None and (item for item in iterable if item) if function is None. filter(None, range(0,10000000000000000000)) Very fast isn’t it? once again, the iterator returned is evaluated only on demand when calling __next__ itertools module: The Python docs also mention the itertools module that add some other functions making use of (or returning) iterators, i will just then pick the one that i found quite important:  itertools. count(start, step) =&gt; returns an infinite stream of evenly spaced values.  itertools. cycle(iterable) =&gt; from an iterable, returns an infinite stream of copies of this iterable itertools. repeat(elem, [n]) =&gt; similar to iterable, but with an element only, repeated infinitely or n times itertools. chain(iterA, iterB, …) =&gt; concatenates the iterables itertools. islice(iterable, [start], stop, [step]) =&gt; from an iterable, return a slice of it.  itertools. tee(iter, [n]) =&gt; copy n times the provided iterator (reminder: once consumed, an iterator cannot be used anymore) itertools. starmap(function, iterable) =&gt; the name is actually well chosen, think of it as a *map or maybe more like map(function, *sequence_of_tuples). For sequences being tuples: it will unpack each tuple and apply the function with multiple unpacked paramaters f(*tuple) itertools. takewhile(predicate, iter): returned an iterator sliced from the iterable till the first falsy value from the predicate is encountered.  itertools. dropwhile(predicate, iter): inverse of takewhileCombinationsFor some use-cases (when creating unit-testing during an internship trying to cover all possible cases, some combinatoric functions where really useful):  itertools. combinations(iter, n): returns an iterator of all psosible combinations of n elements (order doesn’t matter) itertools. permutations(iterable, n): ordre matter (2 different order = 2 possible combinations)For statistics, can be useful to simulate the sample of balls with replacement.  itertools. combinations_with_replacement(iterable, n)functools module:  functools. partial(function, *args, **kwargs): create a partial object, (callable object, just like a function) which when called will behave like the function in parameter, with positional and keyword arguments passed in. VERY USEFUL: functools. reduce(function, sequence, [initial_value]): cumulately perform an operation on each element: function(function(function(x1, x2), x3), x4))For example for a prod: ((x1*x2)*x3)*x4you can provide an initial value (optional) for starting conditions just before x1. What about multiprocessing ?: With reduced memory usage in certain cases, and a evaluation of each item on-demand, iterators/generators are somehow appealing to create pipelines in Data Science for example. One might want to involve multiprocessing with iterators/generators, by splitting the latter in multiple processes. However, even functions defined within generators/iterators are stateless, the iterator construct is inherently stateful: each item are requested using the next() after one has been consumed already. Splitting a generator into multiple processes would lead to make multiple copies of this generator (one for each process: remember that processes have separate memory). You could still use some techniques but sharing memory should be avoided in general, and in most cases would lead no performance gains from the one expected doing true parallelization. So where could we leverage multiprocessing while creating some pipelines and making use of iterators/generators? Well, I see 2 uses cases here, although I’m open to suggestions. If we have an in-memory stored list and not-so-long, we could use multiprocessing. map to take the list as a whole and split it (or not) in multiple chuncks to be fed to the number of processes in the pool. This could speed up the programm mostly if some heavy CPU-bound computations are being done. The side effect is that multiprocessing. map blocks the calling process until all the processes complete and return the results as a whole. We could also use multiprocessing. imap to fed sequentially chuncks (or element) to worker processes from a to-long-to-be-stored-iterable and also return lazily an iterable.  I’ve also found a smart implementation using mapalong with itertools. islice, which will still go through the iterator (can’t slice at any place without calling next on preceding elements as iterator are stateful), but has the benefit to be lazy:   pool. imap(function, itertools. islice(iter, N))here That’s all for this tutorial, I hope it was informative and concise enough, don’t hesitate to reach me or comment below for any questions.
